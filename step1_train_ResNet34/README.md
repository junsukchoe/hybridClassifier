# hybridClassifier


## dependency

1. Tensorpack: https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack (I was using an old version: https://github.com/wuyuebupt/tensorpack)

## 

The training is quite simple. 

First, download the training data from the website (http://www.msceleb.org/download/lowshot)

Second, extract the images from the downloaded CSV file. A template python code can be found at https://github.com/wuyuebupt/MSCELEB1M-GenImage .

Third, prepare the data, generate some basic files, e.g. train.txt, val.txt... and use the script in this folder to train the model

Forth, use your gpu machine to train the model :)
